## This app runs on Cloudflare Workers

It was created with `soli new --edge`. `wrangler.toml` (beside `app/`) is the
deploy config; `soli edge dev` runs the app on workerd with local D1/R2/Queues,
`soli edge build` packages it into `dist/edge`, `npx wrangler deploy` ships it.

- Models are on D1 (SQLite) on the Worker and on SQLite under `soli serve`.
- `.env` is never bundled: the Worker reads `[vars]` in `wrangler.toml` and
  secrets set with `npx wrangler secret put`.
- Not available on the edge: WebSockets/LiveView, SSE/streaming, the `Image`
  class, sending mail, cron, MySQL/SQLite drivers. Background jobs go through
  Cloudflare Queues, uploads through R2 (`service: "r2"`). Reference:
  docs/edge.md.

A Soli application that runs on Cloudflare Workers.

## Develop

```bash
soli edge dev            # the app on workerd, http://localhost:8787, rebuilt as you edit
```

It runs the runtime Cloudflare runs, with a local D1 database under
`dist/edge/.wrangler/state`. `soli serve . --dev` works too, on SQLite
(`.env`). `soli edge dev` needs the edge runtime: pass `--runtime <dir>` or set
`SOLI_EDGE_RUNTIME` to the folder `scripts/build-edge.sh` wrote in the Soli
source tree.

## Deploy

```bash
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler d1 create {db_name}               # put the id in wrangler.toml
npx wrangler secret put SOLI_SESSION_SECRET    # 32+ characters
soli edge build
cd dist/edge && npx wrangler deploy
```

`wrangler.toml` is the deploy config: commit it. Uncomment its R2, Images,
Queues or Hyperdrive blocks when the app needs them; what each one does, and
what stays with `soli serve`, is in `docs/edge.md`.
