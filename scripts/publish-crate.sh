# Publish `solilang` (and its `soli-yaml` dependency) to crates.io.
#
# The manifest cannot be published as it stands: crates.io refuses git and
# unversioned path dependencies, even optional ones, and drops `[patch]`.
# So this script stages HEAD in a temporary directory, rewrites the staged
# manifest, and publishes from there — the repo's Cargo.toml, which CI, the
# release binaries and the Docker image build, stays untouched.
#
# Left out of the crates.io build, because what they need is not on crates.io:
#   eui, eui-desktop  eui-proto / eui-client / eui-score (git)
#   es                es-client (git)
#   solidb-driver     solidb-client (git; crates.io's 0.7.0 is not that code)
#   pdf               soli-pdf, which vendors a patched printpdf
#   codegraph         soli-codegraph (path crate, not published)
#   office            calamine 0.36 needs zip 8.x, all yanked; the repo
#                     patches in vendor/calamine, which publish would drop
# Users who need them install the release binaries or the Docker image.
#
#   ./scripts/publish-crate.sh            # dry run: package and build
